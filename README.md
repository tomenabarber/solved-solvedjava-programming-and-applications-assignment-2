ObjectivesThis assignment requires you to design and implement Java classes to support a Java quiz system using Java JDBC technology. You will apply your knowledge and skills in Java JDBC design and implementation to develop a system that stores Java quiz questions in an embedded Java DB database.Upon completion of this assignment, you should be able to create Java programs to connect to a database, execute SQL statements and process result sets using JDBC. In addition, you should be familiarised with use of the Java DB, in particular the embedded Derby to support your Java applications.Tasks and RequirementsIn this assignment, you will design and implement Java classes that support a Java quiz system using Java DB. The application program, called JavaQuizDB.java, is provided in the Appendix A. You should not modify the application program. Instead, you should design and implement your classes to support it. The application has a text-based user interface that allows a user to register his/her name and take the Java quiz. The user interface class, called UserInterface.java and the Student class are provided in the UserInterface package with documentation. The classes that represent multiple choice questions and true-and-false questions are also provided in the QuestionLibrary package with documentation. Your major work is to create a class, called MyQuestionDB.java to implement the QuestionDB interface to interact with the Java DB. The QuestionDB interface is provided in the Appendix B. All the interaction of your code to the database should be realised using the methods specified by the QuestionDB interface.General Requirements: You should observe the common principles of OO programming when you design your Java classes, which include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. You should create your classes by making use of features of the Java classes You should make proper documentation and implementation comments in your codes where they are necessary. Logical structures and statements are properly used for specific purposes. Your code should comply with the major requirements of Java Code Conventions.Java Programming and Applications – 2 –Structure of the Java packages:The Java classes created in this assignment will have the following package structure. You may add more supporting classes in appropriate packages if necessary./WorkingDirectoryJavaQuizDB.javaderby.jar/au/edu/uow/UserInterfaceUserInterface.classStudent.class/QuestionLibraryQuestion.classMultipleChoiceQuestion.classTrueAndFalseQuestion.class/QuestionDBQuestionDB.javaMyQuestionDB.javaThe UserInterface and QuestionLibrary packages with documentation are provided.Task 1: Database managementRequirements:You program will be responsible to setup the database, create and populate the table, and remove the table when it is no longer needed. The Derby RDMS will be used in embedded mode. The release of the Derby database engine and embedded driver library, derby.jar, to be used in this assignment is provided. This library should be located in your working directory.You should use a properties file, called database.properties, located in your working directory to manage the database. The file contains the following properties:jdbc.driversjdbc.urlderby.system.homeThe Derby system home directory should be called MyQuestionDB located in your working directory, which is set using System.setProperty method before the JDBC driver is loaded. The database to store all question should be called JavaQuestionDB in the Derby system home directory.Task 2: Database creation and populationRequirements:All questions are stored in a table called Questions in the database. The table is created using the following SQL statement:Java Programming and Applications – 3 –CREATE TABLE Questions (Q_ID INT NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS ASIDENTITY (START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1),question CLOB,choices CLOB,answer INT,CONSTRAINT primary_key PRIMARY KEY (Q_ID))You should populate the table using the addQuestion method specified in the QuestionDB interface with questions from the question file with a format as specified in the Appendix C. This table will store both multiple choice questions and true-and-false questions.Before the program exits, the table should be removed. Each execution of the program will start with a new table.All above functions should be implemented programmatically in your program.Task 3: Design and Implementation of the MyQuestionDB ClassRequirements:You should design and implement a class called MyQuestionDB to implement the QuestionDB interface to interact with the database. This class should be created in the au.edu.uow.QuestionDB package. Read the QuesitonDB interface to understand the requirements for the implementation.This class should use JDBC API to interact with a Derby database in the embedded mode.The buildQuestionDB method creates and populates the database table with questions from the question file using the addQuestion method specified in the QuestionDB interface. The makeQuiz method should return a list of randomly selected questions from the database using the getQuestion method specified in the QuestionDB interface. You should use the classes provided in the QuestionLibrary package to represent and manage both types of the questions. Read the accompanying documentation of the package to understand the usage of the package.The JDBC driver and database URL should be loaded into Properties object from the database.properties file.Each method specified in the QuestionDB interface must be implemented by interacting directly with the database. The program should not buffer a collection of question objects.Submission The @author line in all your source code files should include your Subject Code, your name, student ID, and Unix login name. IMPORTANT: Any submission that cannot be decompressed may receive zero mark. Any submission that resulted in compiling errors may have 50% marks deducted. You should first zip your files including subdirectory paths into a file called called a2.zip. For this assignment you submit all your programs including the Java quiz application, Question interface and the generated API documentation, basically all files in the workingJava Programming and Applications – 4 –directory and subdirectories excluding files that may be generated by the IDE you might have used. Failing to do so may result in deduction of marks. Submit the file from your University Unix account on Banshee (banshee.uow.edu.au) as follows:turnin -c csci213 -a a2 a2.zipor, if you submit it after the deadline:turnin -c csci213 -a a2-late a2.zip Use the following command to check the submitted file:turnout -c csci213 -a a2or, if you submit it after the deadline:turnout -c csci213 -a a2-lateMarking SchemeMark to 0.5 divisions.For CSCI213/MCS9213/CSCI813 students.General requirements-0.5 ~ -1.0 mark for each errorTask 12Task 23Task 35Java Programming and Applications – 5 –Appendix A: Java Quiz Application Program(This program is available for downloading)You should not modify this program.

The multiple choice questions, tagged as MQuestion, have three sections that are question, choices and answer while the true and false questions, tagged as TFQuestion, have two sections that are question and answer. Sections may appear in any order and each section may have different numbers of lines or choices.You should not change the format. A sample question file, called questions.xml, is provided for your conformance test.A segment of an example question file is shown below. &lt;JavaQuestions&lt;MQuestion&lt;questionWhich of the following statements is correct?&lt;/question&lt;choicesA class in Java can extend one or more classesA class in Java can extend one class and implement one or more interfacesA class in Java can extend one interface and implement one or two classesA class in Java can extend one class and implement one interface&lt;/choices&lt;answer2&lt;/answer&lt;/MQuestion&lt;TFQuestion&lt;questionSuperclasses can contain abstract methods.&lt;/question&lt;answertrue&lt;/answer&lt;/TFQuestion. . .&lt;/JavaQuestions
